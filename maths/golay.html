M. J. E. Golay (1902-1989) was a Swiss physicist known for his work in
infrared spectroscopy among other things. He was one of the founding
fathers of coding theory, discovering GC24 in 1949 and GC12 in 1954.

There are two closely related binary Golay codes. The extended binary
Golay code, G24 (sometimes just called the "Golay code" in finite group
theory) encodes 12 bits of data in a 24-bit word in such a way that any
3-bit errors can be corrected or any 7-bit errors can be detected.
</P><P>
In the extended binary Golay code, all code words have Hamming weights
  of 0, 8, 12, 16, or 24. Code words of weight 8 are called octads
  and code words of weight 12 are called dodecads.<BR>
The automorphism group of the perfect binary Golay code, G23, is the
  Mathieu group M 23. The automorphism group of the extended binary Golay
  code is the Mathieu group M 24 , of order 210 × 33 × 5 × 7 × 11 × 23.
  M 24 is transitive on octads and on dodecads. The other Mathieu groups
  occur as stabilizers of one or several elements of W.

If G is a matrix, it generates the codewords of a linear code C by
&nbsp;<I> w&nbsp;=&nbsp;sG </I>&nbsp;
where <I>w</I> is a codeword of the linear code C, and <I>s</I> is any input
vector. Both <I>w</I> and <I>s</I> are assumed to be row vectors.
<BR>
A generator matrix for the binary Golay code is <B>I A</B>,
  where <B>I</B> is the 12×12 identity matrix,
  and <B>A</B> is the complement of the adjacency matrix of the icosahedron.

<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance</A><BR>
In information theory, the Hamming distance between two strings of equal
length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are
different. In other words, it measures the minimum number of substitutions
required to change one string into the other, or the minimum number of
errors that could have transformed one string into the other.
</P><P>
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight">
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight</A><BR>
This is equivalent to the Hamming distance from the all-zero string
of the same length.<BR>
In the binary case, it is also called the population count,
popcount, sideways sum, or bit summation<BR>
Intel Core processors introduced a POPCNT instruction with
  the SSE4.2 instruction set extension, first available in a
  Nehalem-based Core i7 processor, released in November 2008.<BR>
The ARM architecture introduced the VCNT instruction
  as part of the Advanced SIMD (NEON) extensions.<BR>
The RISC-V architecture introduced the PCNT instruction
  as part of the Bit Manipulation (B) extension.[34]

How does the right half of the
generator matrix
represent the "adjacency matrix of the icosahedron" as a 12x12,
when &nbsp; 1) the icosahedron has 20 faces
(presumably because it has 12 vertices forming the faces of a dodecahedron,
which is confirmed in
<A HREF="https://giam.southernct.edu/DecodingGolay/encoding.html">
giam.southernct.edu/DecodingGolay/encoding.html</A> :-)),
and &nbsp; 2) how can you number the faces of a dodecahedron
so that 1 is adjacent to 2,3,9,10,11  etc ? &nbsp;
The face-numbering would seem to be arbitrary,
so there are 12! possibilities.  Is there a standard ?<BR>
<A HREF="https://giam.southernct.edu/DecodingGolay/example.html">
giam.southernct.edu/DecodingGolay/example.html</A>
offers a reasonable numbering system, but it does not fit
with this matrix ...<BR>
<A HREF="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/IcosahedralGraph.html">
mathworld.wolfram.com/IcosahedralGraph.html</A>
does display a 12x12 adjacency matrix, but it's not much like
this one ...<BR>

The "Parity" mentioned in
<A HREF="https://giam.southernct.edu/DecodingGolay/example.html">
giam.southernct.edu/DecodingGolay/example.html</A>
is described in
<A HREF="https://giam.southernct.edu/DecodingGolay/encoding.html">
giam.southernct.edu/DecodingGolay/encoding.html</A>
as the sum mod-2 of all the non-adjacent faces.
The "mask" it mentions consists of the adjacent faces.
Bits 1-12 then 13-24 double-cover the 12 faces.
